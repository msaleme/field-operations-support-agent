    </munit:behavior>
    <munit:execution>
        <flow-ref name="transform-data-flow"/>
    </munit:execution>
    <munit:validation>
        <munit:assert-that expression="#[payload.status]" is="#[MunitTools::equalTo('SUCCESS')]"/>
    </munit:validation>
</munit:test>

Claude Instructions for MuleSoft Assistance
When Providing MuleSoft Code Examples

Always include proper error handling
xml<error-handler>
    <on-error-propagate type="HTTP:CONNECTIVITY">
        <logger level="ERROR" message="Connection failed: #[error.description]"/>
    </on-error-propagate>
</error-handler>

Use DataWeave 2.0 syntax
dataweave%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
{
    id: payload.customerId,
    fullName: payload.firstName ++ " " ++ payload.lastName,
    createdDate: now() as String {format: "yyyy-MM-dd"}
}

Include configuration properties
xml<configuration-properties file="config-${mule.env}.yaml"/>

Provide complete flow examples
xml<flow name="process-customer-flow">
    <http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_config" path="/customers"/>
    <logger level="INFO" message="Processing customer: #[payload.id]"/>
    <db:select config-ref="Database_Config">
        <db:sql>SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = :id</db:sql>
        <db:input-parameters>#[{id: payload.id}]</db:input-parameters>
    </db:select>
    <transform doc:name="Transform to Response">
        <ee:message>
            <ee:set-payload><![CDATA[%dw 2.0
                output application/json
                ---
                {
                    customer: payload[0],
                    timestamp: now()
                }]]>
            </ee:set-payload>
        </ee:message>
    </transform>
</flow>


Architecture Recommendations

API key management
JWT token validation
Role-based access control


Data Protection

Encrypt sensitive data
Use secure property configurations
Implement data masking in logs
Follow PCI/HIPAA compliance requirements


Network Security

TLS/SSL configuration
IP whitelisting
VPN connectivity
Firewall rules



Common Patterns and Solutions
Error Handling Pattern
xml<error-handler name="global-error-handler">
    <on-error-propagate type="HTTP:BAD_REQUEST">
        <ee:transform>
            <ee:message>
                <ee:set-payload><![CDATA[%dw 2.0
                output application/json
                ---
                {
                    error: "Bad Request",
                    message: error.description,
                    timestamp: now(),
                    correlationId: correlationId
                }]]></ee:set-payload>
            </ee:message>
            <ee:variables>
                <ee:set-variable variableName="httpStatus">400</ee:set-variable>
            </ee:variables>
        </ee:transform>
    </on-error-propagate>
</error-handler>
Retry Pattern
xml<until-successful maxRetries="3" millisBetweenRetries="1000">
    <http:request config-ref="HTTP_Request_config" path="/api/endpoint"/>
</until-successful>
Async Processing Pattern
xml<async>
    <logger level="INFO" message="Processing asynchronously"/>
    <flow-ref name="heavy-processing-flow"/>
</async>
Documentation Standards
When helping with MuleSoft projects, always:

Provide clear explanations of integration patterns and their use cases
Include complete, runnable examples with proper XML structure
Explain DataWeave transformations step by step
Mention performance implications of different approaches
Include error handling in all code examples
Reference official MuleSoft documentation when appropriate
Consider security implications of proposed solutions
Suggest testing approaches for the implemented solutions
